This directory contains a set of locale files to be used in babel 3.10
ss.  With them, babel will fully support Unicode engines. They are
essentially finished (except bugs and mistakes, of course).

Some of them are still incomplete (but they will be usable), and there
are some omissions (eg, Latin and polytonic Greek, and Spanish and
Arabic have no geographic areas). Hindi, French, Occitan and Breton
will show a warning related to dates. Not all include LICR variants.

This is a preliminary (minimal) documentation (the definitive one will
be added to babel.dtx).

ini files contain the actual data. tex files are currently just
proxies to the corresponding ini files.

Most keys are self-explanatory.

* charset - the encoding used in the ini file.
* version - of the ini file
* level - "version" of the ini specification - which keys are
  available (they may grow in a compatible way) and how they
  should be read.
* encodings - a descriptive list of font encondings.
* [captions] - section of captions in the file charset
* [captions.licr] - same, but in pure ASCII using the LICR
* date.long - fields are as in the CLDR, but the syntax is
  different. Anything inside brackets is a date field (eg, MMMM
  for the month name) and anything outside is text. In addition,
  [ ] is a non breakable space and [.] is an abbreviation dot.

Keys may be further qualified in a particular language with a suffix
starting with a uppercase letter. It can be just a letter (eg,
babel.name.A, babel.name.B) or a name (eg, date.long.Nominative,
date.long.Formal, but no language is currently using the
latter). Multi-letter qualifiers are forward compatible in the sense
they won't conflict with new "global" keys (all lowercase).
