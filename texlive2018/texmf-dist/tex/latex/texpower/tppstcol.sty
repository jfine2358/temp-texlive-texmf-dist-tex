% File: tppstcol.sty
%
% Replacement for ``pstcol.sty'' with some quirks corrected.
% There is a small problem with pstcol.sty which makes it impossible
% to set something like "fillcolor=\linecolor" in pstricks (see LaTeX
% Bug graphics/3366). As this is absolutely indispensible for
% automata.sty, I had to make a modified version to be used until the
% bug is mended.
% The following code is identical with the original pstcol.sty, with
% some modifications to correct the bug.
%
% This package is an addition to the TeXPower bundle, to be found at
%
% http://texpower.sourceforge.net/
%
% Beware! As soon as the original bug in pstcol is corrected, this
% package will be deleted.
