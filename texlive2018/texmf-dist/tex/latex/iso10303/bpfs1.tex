ISO 10303 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable
representation of product information and for the exchange of product data.
The objective is to
provide a neutral mechanism capable of describing products
throughout their life cycle.
This mechanism is suitable
not only for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for
implementing and sharing product databases, and as a basis for archiving.
