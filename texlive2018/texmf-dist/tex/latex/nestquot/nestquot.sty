\ProvidesPackage{nestquot}[1999/12/10 V 0.1 Nested Quotes]
%
% nestquot provides two new commands: \nlq and \nrq for nesting left
% and right quotes that properly change between double and single
% quotes according to their nesting level, e. g. the input
%   \nlq Foo \nlq bar\nrq\ bletch\nrq
% will be typeset as if it had been entered as
%   ``Foo `bar' bletch''
%
% nestquot provides four options:
%
% german    uses german quotes
% french    uses guillemets pointing outward
% guillemet uses guillemets pointing inward, as it is usual in german
%           typesetting. (Note that this is ``guillemet'' without an
%           ``o''. Just beacause Adobe can't spell doesn't mean that
%           we should, too.)
% dq        if nestquot.sty is loaded after german.sty, the quotes "`
%           and "' are redefined to \nlq and \nrq
