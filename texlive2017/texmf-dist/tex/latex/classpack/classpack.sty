%% SERVICE COMMANDS
%%
%% As ClassPack itself is not a document class or package per se, there
%% is no operating code.
%%
%% However, there are some ancillary commands commonly used in
%% documentation which should be expected by authors of classes and
%% packages using ClassPack.
%%
%% This section therefore implements classpack.sty, which gets invoked
%% automatically via its entry in prepost.xml.
%%
%% The doctex package uses a default three-column index, which is too
%% narrow for most purposes. We therefore make the index in two columns,
%% and space them slightly farther apart.
\setcounter{IndexColumns}{2}
\setlength{\columnsep}{3pc}
%%
%% 1  TeX and other logos
%%
%% TeX and LaTeX are defined in the LaTeX kernel, but most of the others
%% are not. The following definitions are taken from the ltugboat
%% package, used for typesetting the TUGboat journal.
%%
%% \ConTeXt{} is a typography and typesetting system meant to provide
%% users easy and consistent access to advanced typographical control (,
%% ).
