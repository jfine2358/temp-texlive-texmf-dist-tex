    The following are the general test purposes for this part of
ISO 10303:

g1 The output of an IUT shall preserve all the semantics defined by
   the input model according to the reference paths specified in the
   mapping \maptableorspec{} defined in clause~5 of ISO 10303-\theAPpartno.

g2 The output of a preprocessor shall conform to the implementation
   method to which the IUT claims conformance.

g3 The instances in the output of a preprocessor shall be encoded
   according to the mapping \maptableorspec{} and the AIM \Express{} long form
   defined in 5.1 and annex~A of ISO 10303-\theAPpartno.

g4 A postprocessor shall accept input data which is encoded according
   to the implementation method to which the IUT claims conformance.

g5 A postprocessor shall accept input data structured
   according to the mapping \maptableorspec{}
   and the AIM \Express{} long form
   defined in 5.1 and annex~A of ISO 10303-\theAPpartno.
