% This package provides support for arbitrary structuring of the way
% label references look.  The \labelformat command takes two
% arguments:
%  #1   the counter that will define the label (e.g., section, figure,
%       enumi, etc.)
%  #2   the definition of how the label will be formatted: in this
%       argument, #1 (*not* ##1) substitutes the `raw' value of the
%       thing which is the source of the label.
%
% The package makes use of a built-in LaTeX facility (which actually
% needs a bit of patching before it's usable); this allows the precise
% layout of the references to labels generated from any LaTeX counter
% to be altered.  Note that the way in which the counter itself is
% represented in references depends on \the<counter> -- it's the same
% as the way the counter gets printed.
%
% example
% \labelformat{section}{section #1}
% ...
% \section{The Blah Field}\label{blah}
% ...
% ... As we saw above in~\ref{blah} ...
%
% will typeset as
% ... As we saw above in section 3 ...
%
% For references at the start of a sentence, the package defines a
% command \Ref, which is used as follows:
% ... \Ref{blah} shows us that ...
%
% which will typeset as
% ... Section 3 shows us that ...
