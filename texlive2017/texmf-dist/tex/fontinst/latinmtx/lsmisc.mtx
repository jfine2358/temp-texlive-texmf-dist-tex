\section{Introduction}

This file sets some miscellaneous smallcaps glyphs, most of which 
serve mainly to complete some family of glyphs whose names are built 
according to some simple pattern. It should work just as well will 
real smallcaps as with faked smallcaps.

\section{Miscellaneous smallcaps}

\subsection{Some glyph aliases}

The next few glyphs are usually available (if any smallcaps glyphs are), 
but may come under a name different from that which ETX files expect.

\begincomment
\subsection{Smallcap ligatures}

Smallcap letters usually do not form ligatures, but many font encodings 
nonetheless reserve slots for them, and in particular many ETX files 
will try to put smallcap ligatures in the ligature slots. Hence there 
is some point in making these glyphs, even though they are only what 
one would get if there was no ligature.

\setint{smallcapsspacing}{0}
\comment{In case some letterspacing will be applied to the smallcaps, 
  then that amount should also be added between the glyphs below. 
  In most cases however, such spacing should already have been 
  included in the base glyphs, and in that case, $0$ is the correct 
  value.}

\comment{That the above glyphs only kern on the right is deliberate. 
  Since they are only put in a horizontal list due to a ligature, 
  they will never occur as the right party when kerning is considered. 
  Not having any kerns on the left simplifies reusing ligature slots 
  as right boundary characters. \texttt{SSsmall} is however a 
  different matter, since that is (in a sense, and probably only if 
  some German spelling reforms are ignored) a proper letter.}
