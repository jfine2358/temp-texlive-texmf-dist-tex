% I gratefully acknowledge the help of J. E. Burke
% <jeburke@jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu>  at Johns Hopkins, who fixed
% the handling of long footnotes.  
% The main idea is from Knuth's \answer macro in the TeXbook.

% version 1.1, May 31, 1995
% Changed \endnoteshere to \theendnotes, since you
% shouldn't use commands that begin with \end
% Also added user renewable parameters

% Based on my old endnotes.sty, version 3
% (Sep 4, 1990, rev. Jul 28, 1994), which was never posted.
% It appears to work with both LaTeX2e and LaTeX2.09
