%%  This version has been slightly modified to ignore lines with a % in
%%  the first column of the address data --- but after the first entry.
%%  I renamed it 'mergeh.sty'                    Brian Housley, 27/07/09
%%
%% A version of these macros appeared in TUGboat 8 #1, April 1987.
%%
%% Merge is a substyle [option] under the Latex style 'Letter' which
%% merges a standard letter with a separate file containing addresses
%% and opening lines.  Merge will read {address}{opening} pairs from a
%% specified file and merge them with a form letter by producing a separate
%% letter environment (containing unique "\begin{letter}{address}" and
%% "\opening{opening}" commands) for each pair.
%%
%% Detailed instructions for preparation of the form letter and the
%% separate address file appear below, after the macros.

%%	27 July 1988
%%	Special Thanks go to B. Beeton (BNB@SEED.AMS.COM) for
%%	-- supplying the raw TeX and documentation from the TUGBoat article;
%%	-- adding some documentation;
%%	-- and for placing this file in the <tex.tugboat> archives at score.
%%
%%	28 July 1988
%%	C. Roberson (csrobe@icase.[arpa|edu], csrobe@[wm]cs.wm.edu)
%%	-- some additional documentation (mostly cleanup for .sty file);
%%	-- changed ID message to a form more similar to LaTeX's;
%%	-- changed "Could not open file" to "Could not open address file"
%%	   so user would better understand for which filename TeX
%%	   was prompting with the string "\@mergefile=";
%%	-- tested merge.sty;  It works!  Thanks, Graeme!
%%	-- submitted file to /public/latex-style archives @ cs.rochester.edu.
%%
%%	6 September 1988
%%	G. McKinstry
%%	-- enhanced the macros to handle running headlines properly;
%%	-- fixed some other problems from the original version not addressed
%%	   fully by C. Roberson;
%%	-- submitted new file to the latex-style archives.

\typeout{Letter Sub-Style 'Merge'. Release 6 October 1986 by Graeme McKinstry}

%% The basic algorithm is:
%%      1. Open the address file.
%%      2. Read the addresses file getting the address and opening line.
%%      3. Process the contents of the MERGE environment and store it
%%         in a box (\@store). This is the standard part of the letter.
%%      4. Produce the start of the letter (your address (including date),
%%         their address, and the opening line).
%%      5. Make a copy of the standard letter (\@store) and unbox this copy.
%%      6. Repeat steps 2, 4, and 5 (not 3) until there are no more addresses.

%% A letter, say LETTER.TEX, would be set up as follows:

%% \documentstyle[merge]{letter}
%%
%% \address{...}		% your address
%% \signature{...}		% your signature
%%
%% \begin{document}
%% \begin{merge}{myaddresses}	% MYADDRESSES.TEX contains addresses+openings
%%
%% With regard to ....		% letter starts
%%
%% \closing{...}		% closing
%% \ps{...}			% \ps, \encl, \cc, etc.
%%
%% \end{merge}
%% \end{document}

%% The address file, MYADDRESSES.TEX, would contain:

%% {Computing Services Centre, \\	% first address
%%  University of Otago, \\
%%  Dunedin, \\
%%  New Zealand}
%% {Dear Graeme,}		% \opening for first address
%% {Charles S. Roberson\\	% next address
%%  Dept. of Computer Science\\
%%  College of William and Mary\\
%%  Williamsburg, VA  23185}
%% {Dear Chip,}			% next \opening
%% ....				% etc.

%% NOTES:
%%   Braces are matched, except that if the input is only one line then it
%%     is not necessary to contain it within braces.
%%   It is important to leave NO BLANK LINES at the end of the address file.
%%   Be sure to supply the "\\" for breaking the addresses. -csr
