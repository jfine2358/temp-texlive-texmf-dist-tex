% Envelopes 
% Latex option file to print addresses onto a 9.5x4.125 envelope fed through 
% the manual paper feed on HP LaserJet 4SIMX.
% SAMPLE FILE :
%
%\documentstyle[12pt,envelope]{article}
%\begin{document}              
%\from{name\\ address\\ city/state}	%define return address
%\to{name\\ address\\ city/state}	%define destination address
%\envelope				%actually create envelope
%\end{document}
%
%Create postscript file with
% 	dvips -m -t landscape <filename>.dvi
%
%Feed envelope into printer through manual feed rack with printing side up and
%with the RIGHT edge of the envelope the edge with the flap.
%Since the trailing edge of the envelope gets mangled by the printer often,
%this starts printing on the leading edge.
