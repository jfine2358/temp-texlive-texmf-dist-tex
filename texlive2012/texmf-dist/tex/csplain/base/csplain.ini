Information about changes (since <Apr. 1995>)
=============================================

** 1 ** <Aug. 1996>
file extcode.tex renamed to il2code.tex (suggested by Jan Kasprzak)

** 2 ** <Sep. 1996>
* New metrics of cs-fonts loaded (T\v reba has no kern between T\v r).
* File il2code.tex:
  - \icrqq, \protect: removed
  - \def\crqq{\protect\irrqq} -> \chardef\crqq=255 \sfcode255=0
  - The definition \def\foo{\char<number> } -> \chardef\foo=<number> 
    for following \foos: \clqq, \flqq, \frqq.
  - New definition of \ogonek (the \ogonek A is improoved).
  - \defaulthyphenchar=\extrahyphenchar added to \extrahyphens macro.
  - The \uv definition added.

** 3 ** <Oct. 1998>
* The input re-encoding possibility using encTeX primitives added.
* Files enc-k.tex, enc-w.tex and enc-p.tex added.
* You can use (for example):   tex -enc -ini \let\enc=k \input csplain.ini
  to activate the encTeX reencoding

** 4 ** <Feb. 2000>
* The Czech/Slovak patterns are loaded in T1 encoding too: hyphen.lan  
  was modified, \toneczech, \toneslovak, \iltwoczech, \iltwoslovak
  \chardef's was introduced. The default encoding was keep ISO-8859-2.
* You can use (for example):  tex -ini \let\Cork=\relax \input csplain.ini
  to suppress the loading hyphen patterns in T1 encoding.
* You can use (for example):  %&csplain -translate-file=il2-t1
                              \input t1code \chyph
                              \font\f=ptmr8t \f
                              Here is czech text processed in T1 encoded
                              font ptmr8t and hyphenated by right
                              pattern table. \end

** 5 ** <Feb. 2005>
* The possibility of csplain initialisation by pdfTeX added
  (see \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined \else ... \fi).
* The file pdftexconfig.tex during pdfcsplain initialisation is read
  (see \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined \else ... \fi).
* The file t1code.tex corrected (bug in \uccodes removed).
  
** 6 ** <Sep. 2005>
* Files enc-k.tex, enc-w.tex, enc-p.tex renamed to csenc-*.tex because
  only characters from Czech and Slovak alphabet are declared here.
* Commands \let\xordcode=\undefined etc. are removed, but user is kindly 
  asked to use encTeX primitives with care. The result may be unportable 
  document with another csplain implementations.
* File csenc-u.tex for UTF8 input encoding using encTeX is added.
  You can use (for example):  tex -enc -ini \let\enc=u \input csplain.ini
  if your system (or text editor) is using UTF8 encoding.

** 7 ** <Sep. 2007>
* Only the Copyright text was changed in order to the "GNU" name is not
  mentioned in it. The meaning of Copyright is unchanged.
  I was forced to do this change by Debian people. They consider the
  license as very important but I don't. IMHO the functionality of 
  the software is much more important.
* I didn't do any changes in macro code. Thus the \message still says:
  The format: csplain <Sep. 2005>.
