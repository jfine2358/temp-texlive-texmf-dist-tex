%% package may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions of the
%% GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
%% either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
%% The distribution consists of the following files:
%% 
%%    xypdf.dtx  -  Documented source code
%%    xypdf.ins  -  Installation script
%%    xypdf.pdf  -  Documentation (generated from xypdf.dtx)
%% 
%% The files with the TeX code are generated by the following command:
%% 
%%    latex xypdf.ins
%% 
%% This generates the files xypdf.tex, xypdf-co.tex, xypdf-cu.tex,
%% xypdf-fr.tex, xypdf-li.tex and xypdf-ro.tex.

%% The xypdf package improves the output quality of the Xy-pic package when
%% PDF documents are generated. It produces generic PDF code for graphical
%% elements like lines, curves and circles instead of approximating these
%% elements with glyphs in special fonts as the original Xy-pic package does.
%% The xypdf package works with both TeX and LaTeX in the occurrences of
%% pdfTeX, XeTeX and eTeX with dvipdfm(x) to generate PDF files. It is being
%% integrated and distributed together with Xy-pic, starting with Xy-pic
%% version 3.8.
%% 
%% The copyright for the xypdf package is by its author, Daniel Müllner
