% USAGE:
% 
% Write a script file like gather.tex which you should have received 
% together with myfilist.sty. We use LaTeX2e (required!), yet (in 
% general) not for typesetting a document, therefore the script file 
% needn't contain \documentclass. myfilist.sty is loaded by 
% 
%     \RequirePackage{myfilist}
% 
% instead of \usepackage{myfilist}. Usually you don't want to have 
% myfilist.sty in the list, so type 
%
%     \EmptyFileList 
%
% next; or type it after some additional \RequirePackage... for 
% packages you want to use but not list. 
%
% Next list the names of the files 
% whose informations you want to get as arguments of 
%
%     \ReadFileInfos  or  \ReadPackageInfos  or  \ReadClassInfo
%
% With the latter two, you can omit ".sty" or ".cls" as with 
% \usepackage and \documentclass. With the first one, the file name 
% extension ".tex" may be omitted. The two first commands accept lists 
% with commas as separators almost like with \usepackage (currently we 
% must use "%" to hide a line break in the script, and there must be 
% no spaces in the list).---For more details on these commands, 
% please see readprov.pdf.
% 
% The list of files is actually printed in the transcript .log 
% and on screen on
%
%     \ListInfos
%
% The list can additionally be written into a plain text file, 
% 
%     \ListInfos[filelist.txt]
%
% as an example; i.e., you can use the brackets to tell which file is 
% to contain your list of files. The file informations appear in the 
% order of their names in your script file. 
% 
% \ListInfos concludes, ends the job, anything following in the 
% script file will be ignored.---All of this requires %% 2010/04/02
% that you run gather.tex or your other script file, about as
%
%     latex gather
%
% To list files that were loaded earlier in a different order, 
% list them in an \emph{optional argument} of \EmptyFileList, e.g.,
% % trick avoiding main replacement 2010/11/26:
%
%     \EmptyFileList[myfilist-.sty,readprov-.sty]
%
% NOTE: myfilist.sty (in its present state) is unable to list files 
% that don't contain \ProvidesPackage, \ProvidesClass, or 
% \ProvidesFile. myfilist.sty "loads" files to extract version 
% informations, but quits them as soon as it has found one of these
% LaTeX2e commands.
