% Say I want to define a class, MCC (My Complexity Class)
% I would use the following command:
%
% \newcommand{\MCC}{\ComplexityFont{MCC}}
%
% Then, in my actual document, I would use something like
% $\MCC \subseteq \NP \cap \coNP$ to typeset it.
%
% In this file, you should also include any other standard inputs that you use.
% For instance, I have a .tex file that defines a bunch of Math Mode shortcuts,
% I would include it here as follows:


\newcommand{\TIME}{\ComplexityFont{TIME}}
