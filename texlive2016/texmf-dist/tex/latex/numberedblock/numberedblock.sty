% numberedblock provides several routines 
% intended to print out a block of code with a unique,
% sequentially indexed label.  The code block is printed to the left,
% with the block label printed centered vertically on the code block,
% horizontally right-justified.  Each line of code is not numbered... 
% rather, the block of code gets a single label.
%
% There are three parameters with which the user may freely alter:
% 1) maxblocklabelsize is a length set aside for the code-block labels.
%    If it is too small, the label will run off the right margin; too large
%    and it limits the width of the code block itself.  However, by setting
%    this parameter to a negative value, it will force the label to be
%    offset into the right margin, which may be a desirable feature.
% 2) blockindent is a length defining the left-side indent to be used
%    for the code block to be printed.
% 3) blocklabel is the command that actually formats the block label to
%    the desired appearance.  Currently, italicized numbers are used within
%    non-italicized square brackets to comprise the block label.
%
% There is a command-line version called numblock, which cannot
% handle verbatim input.  And there is an environment called numVblock
% which handles cases invloving verbatim input
%
% An example of how to use numberedblock is given below.  The
% double-backslash is used for linebreaks in the code. Tildes need to
% be used for hard spaces under two conditions: when the code contains
% multiple sequential spaces; and if a space follows a period (which
% would otherwise invoke end-of-sentence spacing considerations).  In
% addition, special LaTeX characters need to be quoted in the
% appropriate manner of LaTeX.
%
%   \numblock{Line 1 of code\\Line 2 of code\\Line 3...\nblabel{mylabel}}
%
% A label may set to the code block with \nblabel{}.
%
% In contrast, the numVblock environment is a verbatim environment.
% A label may be passed to numVblock through an optional argument, via 
% \nbVlabel{}.
%
%   \begin{numVblock}[\nbVlabel{mylabel}]
%         program test
%         implicit none
%         integer a, x
%         a = 0
%         x = 1
%      10 a = a + x
%         if (a .eq. 100) stop
%         goto 10
%         end
%   \end{numVblock}
%
% The font used for the code block itself is the ttfamily (typewriter)
% of fixed-width characters.  The counter named blocknum is used to
% index the code block sequence.
%
% V1.1 - Added the hyperref-compatible capability to label and
%        reference numbered blocks.
