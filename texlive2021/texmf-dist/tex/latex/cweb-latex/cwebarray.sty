% LaTeX style option cwebarray

\ProvidesPackage{cwebarray}


%
% What's this style option for?
%
% If you use CWEB, you cannot use vertical bars (`|') as rule specifiers in
% tables any more; CWEAVE processes them already. This style option
% defines `I' (that's an uppercase i) as a replacement for the
% vertical bar.
%
% I.e., write
%
%	\begin{tabular}{lIl}
%
% instead of \begin{tabular}{l|l}.

% This option won't work without the array style.

% Revision 1.2  1995/08/08  00:14:31  schrod
% Updated to \LaTeXe{}, the |cweb| style is now a document class. Used
% my standard templates for that, no changes in functionality.
%
% Revision 1.1  1993/08/09  18:05:55  schrod
%     Mentioned that `|' cannot be used for LaTeX purposes, in
% particular, not for ruled tables. Described workarounds, one of them
% is the new style option cwebarray.
