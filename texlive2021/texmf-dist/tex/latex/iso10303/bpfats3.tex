    Application element (AE) test purposes are implicitly derived
from the AP information requirements and are not explicitly documented
here. AE test purposes apply to the input specifications of both
preprocessr and postprocessor test cases. AE test purposes are implicitly
derived from the AP information requirements as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Application objects (see ISO 10303-\theAPpartno, 4.2):
  a test purpose derived from an application object is a simple
  statement of the object's name;

\item Application object attributes (see ISO 10303-\theAPpartno, 4.2):
  test purposes derived from application object attributes are
  statements of the application object name with a specific attribute name;

\item Application assertions (see ISO 10303-\theAPpartno, 4.3):
  test purposes derived from application assertions are
  statements describing the relationships between two application objects.
  Application assertion test purposes address the directions of
  relationships as well as the number (cardinality) of relationships.

\end{itemize}

They shall be interpreted as given in the
following statement:
    the IUT shall preserve the semantic associated with the unique
application element from which the test purpose was implicitly derived.
This implies that the semantics of the application element are
preserved by the IUT between the input and output of a test,
according to the reference path specified by the mapping
\maptableorspec{}
defined in ISO 10303-\theAPpartno, 5.1.
