    In the preprocessor input specification table of this test case, the
numbers in the Id column (ignoring the part beyond the decimal point, if any)
whose rows are not empty in the V column identify the application objects
that are covered by this test case. These Id numbers refer directly to
the subclause numbers within ISO 10303-\theAPpartno, 4.2, where the
application object is defined.
