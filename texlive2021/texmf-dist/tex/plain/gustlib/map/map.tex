\def\map
      % for each element E of the token list #2
      % ``execute'' the token list #1
      % possibly making use of the following macros:
      %   \mappre   the token list before E (without E)
      %   \mapcur   the token E
      %   \mappost  the token list after E (without E)
      %   \mapupto  the token list from the beginning till and including E
      %   \mapfrom  the token list from and including E till the end
      %   \mapent   the entire token list
