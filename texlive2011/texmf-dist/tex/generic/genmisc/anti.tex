% \anti -- Definition.
% Produce a superscripted antiparticle: #1 with an overbar and a super-
% script #2.  Looks better than \overline{{#1}^{#2}} (bar does not extend over
% superscript) or {\overline {#1}}^{#2} (superscript does not stick up above
% bar; in fact, superscript is at same height as for the charge conjugate,
% {#1}^{#2}).  If you want subscripts too, you'll have to modify
% this definition to take a third argument.  Math mode is assumed.
