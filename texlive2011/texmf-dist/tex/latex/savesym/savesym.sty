% The following package was originally pinched (with permission) from
% similar makros in symbols.tex, written by Scott Pakin <pakin@uiuc.edu>.
% The following explanation was also taken from symbols.tex.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% There are a number of symbols (e.g., \Square) that are defined by      %
% multiple packages.  In order to typeset all the variants in this       %
% document, we have to give glyph a unique name.  To do that, we define  %
% \savesymbol{XXX}, which renames a symbol from \XXX to \origXXX, and    %
% \restoresymbols{yyy}{XXX}, which renames \origXXX back to \XXX and     %
% defines a new command, \yyyXXX, which corresponds to the most recently %
% loaded version of \XXX.                                                %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% The implementation of \savesymbol and \restoresymbol was changed by
% Heiko Oberdiek <oberdiek@uni-freiburg.de>
% and
% Rolf Niepraschk <rolf.niepraschk@ptb.de>
% in May 2003. Thank you!
