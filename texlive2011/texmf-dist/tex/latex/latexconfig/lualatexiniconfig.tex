% Rationale for primitives prefixing.
%
% 1 All current macro packages run smoothly on top of pdf(e)TeX, so those
%   primitives are left untouched.
% 
% 2 Other non-TeX82 primitives in LuaTeX may cause name clashes with
%   existing macros in macro packages, especially when they use very
%   "natural" names such as \outputbox, \mathstyle etc. Such a
%   probability for name clashes is undesirable, since the most existing
%   LaTeX documents that run without change under LuaTeX, the better.
%   
% 3 The LuaTeX team doesn't want to apply a systematic prefixing policy,
%   but kindly provided a tool allowing prefixes to be applied. So we
%   chose to use it.  Previously, we even disabled the extra primitives,
%   but now we feel it's better to enable them with systematic
%   prefexing, in order to avoid that each and every macro package (or
%   user) enables them with various and inconsistent prefixes (including
%   the empty prefix).
%   
% 4 The 'luatex' prefix was chosen since it is already used as a prefix
%   for some primitives, such as \luatexversion: this way, those
%   promitive don't end up with a double prefix (see
%   tex.enableprimitives in the luatex manual for details).
%   
% 5 The \directlua primitive is provided both with its natural name
%   (allowing easy detection of LuaTeX-besed formats) and a prefixed
%    version \luatexdirectlua (for consistency with \luatexlatelua).
%   
% 6 Various remarks:
% (a) The obvious drawback of such a prefixing policy is that the names
%     used by LaTeX or generic macro writer won't match the names used
%     in the manual.  We hope this is compensated by the gain in
%     backwards compatibility.
%     
% (b) All primitives dealing with Unicode math already begin with \U,
%     and maybe will match the names of XeTeX primitives some day, so
%     maybe prefixing was not necessary/desirable for them. However, we
%     tried to make the prefixing rule as simple as possible, so that
%     point (a) doesn't get even worse.
%     
% (c) The final name of some primitive may sound strange, namely those
%     already containing the name of an engine, such as
%     \luatexOmegaVersion.  However, since LuaTeX is not a drop-in
%     replacement for Omega/Aleph, we felt it wrong to provide
%     \OmegaVersion.
%     
% (d) Maybe some day we'll feel it's better to provide all
%     primitives without prefixing. If this happens, it
%     will be easy to add the unprefixed primitives in the format while
%     keeping the prefixed names for compatibility. It wouldn't work the
%     other way round; i.e., belaatedly realizing that we should not
%     provide the unprefixed primitives would then cause break
%     any LuaTeX-specific macro packages that had been written.
