%   The Scientific Paper Package for LaTeX
%   By Ryan Aycock March 26, 2004
%   
%    For use with LaTeX pdflatex.
%
% YOU MUST HAVE THE MULTICOL PACKAGE
%
% This package will allow you to write generic scientific papers with two column text
% and a single column, centered abstract.  this format is not based on any published
% style guide and should modified as needed.
%
% To use, simply build your document with this template:
%
% \documentclass[letterpaper,11pt]{article}
% \usepackage{science}
% \title{Ultra Cool Title}
% \author{Your Name}
% \date{the date}  % Can use \today
% \begin{document}
% \maketitle
% \begin{abstract}
% Type your abstract here.
% \end{abstract}
% \begin{body}
% Type your paper as normal.  Use \cite{} for your citations.
% \begin{bib}
% Put your bibliography here.  Use \bibitem{} for
% each of the citations used in your paper.
% \end{bib}
% \end{body}
% \end{document}
%
%
% If you have more than one author or wish to list your school and contact 
% information, use the following:
%
% \author{First author's name$^{1}$\thanks{Contact information}, 
% Second author$^{2}$\\
% $^{1}$\textit{First university}\\
% $^{2}$\textit{Second university}}
%
%
%
% Floating environments such as figures or tables are
% forbidden in the multicol environment.  To get around
% this limitation, you have two options when including
% a figure or table:
%
% use \begin{figurehere}... \end{figurehere}
% and \begin{tablehere}... \end{tablehere}
% to place a float in the two column format (right here).
% Or you can use \begin{figure*} \begin{table*}.  These
% commands will span your float body across the page, usually
% at the top --- best for large images and tables.
%
%
% If you have any questions about how \cite and \bibitem work, consult
% the "Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX."
%
% Note: The bibliography assumes that you are using LaTeX's build-in
% bibliography and not BibTeX or another package.  Also, this package
% assumes that you will have less than 99 sources.  If you should use more,
% you will have to edit the bib environment.
