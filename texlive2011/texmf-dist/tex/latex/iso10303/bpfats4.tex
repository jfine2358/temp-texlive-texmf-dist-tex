    Test purposes are implicitly derived from the AP AIM \Express,
and are not explicitly documented here. AIM test purposes are implicitly
derived from the expanded \Express{} listing contained in
annex~A of ISO 10303-\theAPpartno{} as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item AIM entity data types: a test purpose derived from an AIM
      entity data type is a simple statement of the entity data type name;

\item AIM entity attributes: a test purpose derived from an AIM
      entity attribute is a statement of the AIM entity data type with
      a given attribute.
\end{itemize}

    Aim test purposes shall be interpreted as given in the
following statement:
the postprocessor shall accept the input in accordance with the
AIM \Express{} structure corresponding to this test purpose.
This implies that the semantics of the application element
represented by the AIM element are preserved by the IUT between
the input and output of a test according to the reference path
specified in the mapping
\maptableorspec{}
of the AP. This also implies
no violations of any constraints (local rules or global
rules) that apply to the AIM element. AIM test purposes apply
to the input specifications of postprocessor test cases only.
