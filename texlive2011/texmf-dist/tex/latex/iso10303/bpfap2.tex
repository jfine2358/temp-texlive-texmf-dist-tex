  The information requirements are specified as a set of
units of functionality, application objects, and
application assertions. These assertions pertain to
individual application objects and to relationships
between application objects. The information requirements
are defined using the terminology of the subject area of
this application protocol.

\begin{note}A graphical representation of the information
      requirements is given in \aref{;sarm}.\end{note}
\begin{note}The information requirements correspond to those of
      the activities identified as being within the scope of this
      application protocol in \aref{;saam}.\end{note}
\begin{note}The mapping \maptableorspec{}
      specified in~\ref{;smap} shows how the
      integrated  resources
      \ifaicinap and application interpreted constructs \fi
      are used to meet the information requirements of this
      application protocol. \end{note}
