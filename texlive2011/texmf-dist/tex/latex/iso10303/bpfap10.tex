  This clause lists the optional elements of this part
of ISO~10303. An implementation may choose to support
any combination of these optional elements. However,
certain combinations of options are likely to be
implemented together. These combinations are called
conformance classes and are described in the subclauses
of this annex.

  This annex is in the form of a questionnaire. This
questionnaire is intended to be filled out by the
implementor and may be used in preparation for conformance
testing by a testing laboratory. The completed PICS proforma
is referred to as a PICS.
