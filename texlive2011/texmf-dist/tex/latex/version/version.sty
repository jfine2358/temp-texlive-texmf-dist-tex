%
% Version control macros. This package lets you define environments whose 
% contents will be optionally included in or excluded from the text when 
% you run LaTeX.
%
% Maybe you should be using one of versions.sty, comment.sty, or optional.sty. 
%
% Usage:
%     
%       \includeversion{NAME}
% After this declaration, contents of the environment "NAME", that is,
% text between \begin{NAME} and \end{NAME}, will be processed in the 
% normal way.  If an environment called NAME is already defined, that
% definition is retained; if no such environment exists a simple 
% definition is provided.
%
%       \excludeversion{NAME}
% This indicates that text between \begin{NAME} and \end{NAME} will
% be totally deleted. Very long sections of excluded text might cause 
% a `TeX capacity exceeded' error.  Exclusion ends with the first
% detected \end{NAME}, even if there are additional \begin{NAME} 
% declarations in the skipped text; that is, nesting of environments
% is not permitted.  Skipped text may have unbalanced braces, if
% they would also work in the \includeversion case.
%
%       \excludeversion[text]{NAME}
% This indicates that text between \begin{NAME} and \end{NAME} will
% be replaced by the specified text.
%
% You can define environments for as many versions as you want.
% A `comment' environment has already been pre-defined with
% \excludeversion{comment}; you can override this by declaring 
% \includeversion{comment}.
%
% Example:
%   \includeversion{abridged}\excludeversion{unabridged}
%   \excludeversion[(redacted)]{redact}
%   Text for the
%   \begin{abridged}
%      short
%   \end{abridged}
%   \begin{unabridged}
%      long and really longwinded, opaque and boring
%   \end{unabridged}
%   version of the paper. Punctuation works correctly\begin{unabridged}
%   because sphack is used\end{unabridged}.
%   \begin{comment} This is deleted by default. \end{comment}
%   \begin{redact}This information was withdrawn\end{redact}

% version v. 2 based on version.sty by:
% Stephen Bellantoni 1990, loosely based on "annotation.sty" by Tom Hofmann.
%
% Donald Arseneau produced this version because Stephen Bellantoni had no 
% permissions explicitly stated in his version.  DA has tried to remain
% compatible but has indulged in "upgrades" (bloat) which might not be 
% proper.
%
% Although the code is entirely rewritten, there are a few principal 
% differences with version 2:
%
% Verbatim catcoding of braces (to scan over unbalanced braces) is
% still applied, but is not required to be effective: the \end{NAME}
% will be detected whether the catcode changes are effective or not.
%
% Verbatim catcode for & is set to allow skipping rows of a tabular.
%
% Definitions of existing environments are now retained by \includeversion,
% unless the existing definition is the one made by \excludeversion.
%
% Added optional argument for \excludeversion for a textual tag to 
% replace the excluded content.
