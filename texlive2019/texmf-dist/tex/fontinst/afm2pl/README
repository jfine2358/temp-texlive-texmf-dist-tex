This directory contains support files to generate small-caps fonts
from texnansi-encoded tfm's. The fontinst command should be
something like

\installfont{XXXrc8y}{XXXr8y,latin}{ly1c}
  {ly1}{XXX}{m}{sc}{}

This means: generate XXXrc8y.vpl from XXXr8y.pl and latin.mtx using
encoding ly1c.etx and tell LaTeX that it has encoding ly1, family
name XXX, series m and shape sc. The last, empty, parameter is an
optional size specification.

See makesc8y.tex for an example fontinst input file. It should be
processed by LaTeX or PdfLaTeX.

Fontinst appears to require pl files with a different unit length
than produced by afm2pl. applying first pltotf and then tftopl fixes
this.

The files have been created for fontinst version 1.8
