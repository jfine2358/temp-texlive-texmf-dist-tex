%% This configuration file modifies the layout defined by the spanish option 
%% of the babel package to use a site-wide `mexican' style for your spanish 
%% documents if included in your TeXmf path. 
%% It is roughly equivalent to the `mexico' option defined by spanish.ldf v5.x.
%% To make it work, you should include it in the file spanish.cfg installed 
%% in your texmf tree, saying
%%
%% \input esmx.cfg
%%
