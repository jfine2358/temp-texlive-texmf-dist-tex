% Usage
% ~~~~~
%
% This package modifies the definitions of \frontmatter and
% \mainmatter so that page numbering starts in arabic style from the
% front matter while preserving the rest of the original definitions.
% For it to work, \pagenumbering has to be inside these macros -- most
% of classes do that, but there are exceptions like memoir.
%
% To use it, just \usepackage{arabicfront}.
