  1. GENERAL FEATURES

     LaTeX 2e style lhcyrkoi is intended for typesetting Russian or
     bilingual English-Russian documents. Other latin-alphabet
     languages will probably work as well but none where tested.

     The style is based on the so called lh-fonts in the KOI-8
     encoding which is standard for Russian in the UNIX world.
     It works by replacing each standard TeX computer modern text
     font by the analogous lh-font (e.g. cmr10 -> kcr10 etc
     replacing all 'cm' by 'kc').  Upper part of an lh-font (character
     codes 0-127) exactly coincides with the corresponding cm-font and
     its lower part (codes 128-255) contains Russian alphabet in the
     KOI-8 encoding together with some extra symbols such as
     Russian number sign and angular double quotes.

     The installation described below is teTeX specific but provides
     rather good idea how the package can be installed with other
     TeX distributives. Below $TEXMF stands for the main teTeX directory.
     You can find out about the actual value of the $TEXMF by the command
       kpsexpand '$TEXMF'

     The lhcyrkoi package consists of the following files:

        README             - this file

        kniga.tex
        otchet.tex
        pismo.tex
        rusfonts.tex
        statya.tex


  2. INSTALLING FONTS

     First of all make sure that you have metafont sources for
     standard cm (Knuth's computer modern) fonts. They are used to form
     the upper part of the lh-fonts. If not then get them at
       CTAN: /tex-archive/fonts/cm

     Next get latest lh-fonts distributive. It available at
       CTAN: /tex-archive/fonts/cyrillic/lh
       ftp:  ftp.vsu.ru/pub/tex

     Create some temporary directory and unpack .zip or .tar.gz lh-font
     archive. Go into the subdirectory /tex and create in it directory
     /tex/wrk (if absent). Return to /tex and run plain TeX on 24cm-kc.tex
       tex 24cm-kc.tex
     This will create several files in the /tex/wkr directory.
     Copy all *.mf files from the directory /mf (about 750K) and
     from the directory /tex/wrk into the place where your Metafont
     looks for *.mf source files (say $TEXMF/fonts/source/public/lh).

     Unpack kcmf.tgz into the same directory
       tar zvxf kcmf.tgz

     Append the file special.kc to the file $TEXMF/fontname/special.map
       cat special.kc >> special.map
     Do not forget >> or you'll owerwrite your special.map! It is better
     to save it before appending special.kc to be on the safe side.

     Refresh teTeX database by running
       texhash

     Create *.tfm files
       sh maketfms.sh
     This step takes from several minutes up to one hour depending
     on your computer.

     If you have testfont.tex you may test lh-fonts by running
       tex testfont
     when prompted for font name type
       kcr10
       \table\end
     and print or preview the resulting tesfont.dvi.


  3. GENERATING FORMAT FILE

     To enable correct Russian hyphenation you have to create a new
     LaTeX 2e format file. With the lhcyrkoi style both English and Russian
     languages are represented as one combined language (from the TeX's
     point of view). With such setup you can freely mix English and Russian
     words with correct hyphenation for both languages without any
     language switching commands. This approach is orthogonal to the method
     used by the standard LaTeX babel package. With babel each language is
     stored separately (you may have more than two languages but must
     use explicit language switching commands). If the babel package is
     installed on your system you must disable it (at least temporary
     during LaTeX format generation).

     Rename any hyphen.cfg file to something else. In teTeX this file
     resides in the babel's directory $TEXMF/tex/generic/babel. Rename
     it to hyphen.cfg.babel or something like this.

     Copy the file  hyphen.cfg  into $TEXMF/tex/latex/base

     Copy the file  rhyphen.tex  into $TEXMF/tex/generic/hyphen

     Make sure that you have the file ushyph1.tex (directory
     $TEXMF/tex/generic/hyphen) and this file is the original
     Knuth's US-English hyphenation patterns file. If this haphenation
     table has other name or if you want to use some other English
     hyphenation tables (say UK-patterns) edit hyphen.cfg and replace
     {ushyph1.tex} by desired pattern file name.

     Refresh teTeX database by running
       texhash

     Go into directory $TEXMF/web2c and create new LaTeX format file
       initex latex.ltx


  4. USING lhcyrkoi STYLE

     Copy lhcyrkoi.sty and all *.fd files into the directory
     $TEXMF/tex/latex/ and refresh teTeX files database
       texhash

     To use lhcyrkoi stile include the line

       \usepackage{lhcyrkoi}

     into the LaTeX document header. With this style you can freely
     type English and Russian in the KOI-8 encoding. Besides you get
     three extra commands
        \No  \<  \>
     for Russian number sign and Russian angular double quotes.

     With the additional [russtyle] option enabled

       \usepackage[russtyle]{lhcyrkoi}

     all English texts such as "Chapter", "Appendix" are replaced
     by the corresponding Russian translations "Glava","Prilozhenie" etc.

     You may test lhcyrkoi style by latexing test files
       karabas.tex
       rusfonts.tex
     and sample files
       kniga.tex
       otchet.tex
       pismo.tex
       statya.tex
