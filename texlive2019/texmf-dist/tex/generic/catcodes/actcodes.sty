%%  == Purpose and Usage            ==
%% The package derives from switching category codes 
%% in the 'nicetext' and 'morehype' bundles and should 
%% improve them. 
%% 
%% === Installing and Calling       ===
%% The file `actcodes.sty' is provided ready, 
%% installation only requires
%% putting it somewhere where \TeX\ finds it
%% (which may need updating the filename data
%%  base).\urlfoot{ukfaqref}{inst-wlcf} 
%% However, the files `plainpkg.tex' and `stacklet.sty' %% stacklet 2012/09/19
%% must be installed likewise.
%% 
%% \emph{With} \LaTeX, the file should be loaded by `\RequirePackage{actcodes}'
%% or `\usepackage{actcodes}'. 
%% 
%% \emph{Without} \LaTeX, load it by `\input actcodes.sty'.
%%
%% As explained in `plainpgk-doc.pdf', however, ``generic" 
%% packages based on 'plainpkg' should load 'actcodes' by 
%% `\RequirePackage{actcodes}'.
%%
%% === Commands and Syntax          ===
%% \label{sec:actcodes-cmds}
%% 'actcodes.sty' provides \ |\MakeActive|, |\MakeActiveAss|, 
%% |\MakeActiveDef|, |\MakeActiveLet|, 
%% |\MakeOther|, |\MakeActiveOther| \ with rather obvious 
%% syntax---you find more detailed descriptions 
%% mixed with implementation below ... TODO
%% ---Without \LaTeX, the latter's internal |\@gobble<arg>|
%% is provided as well.
%%

%% === The Core                     ===
%% |\MakeActiveAss<ass-fun>\<char><ass-args>| ``activates" <char> 
%% and then applies assignment function <ass-fun> with arguments 
%% <ass-args> to it. The code derives from \LaTeX's
%% `\@sverb' and `\do@noligs' and was also discussed 
%% on the \acro{LATEX-L} mailing list September 2010
%% (Will Robertson; Heiko Oberdiek). 
%% The present definition generalizes 
%% `\MakeActiveDef' and `\MakeActiveLet' of my earlier packages.
\gdef\MakeActiveAss#1#2{%
  \MakeActive#2%
  \begingroup \lccode`\~`#2\relax \lowercase{\endgroup #1~}} 
%% I was reluctant to provide |\MakeActive\<char>|, 
%% but with 'catchdq.sty', it would be better ...   %% 2012/09/16
\gdef\MakeActive#1{\catcode`#1\active}
%% ... it just ``revives" the meaning that the corresponding 
%% active-character token last time ...
%%
%% === \cs{def} and \cs{let}        ===
%% |\MakeActiveDef\<char><parameters>{<replace>}| 
%% has been employed in 'fifinddo' and 'blog' 
%% (which is based on 'fifinddo') so far. 
\gdef\MakeActiveDef{\MakeActiveAss\def}
%% W.r.t.\ the definition of this `\MakeActiveDef', 
%% Heiko Oberdiek remarked that it allows \emph{macro parameters}, 
%% as opposed to my earlier definition in 'fifinddo'. 
%% Without parameters, this kind of macro has been used for 
%% conversion of text encodings ('atari.fdf', 
%% and I thought this was the idea of \ctanpkgref{stringenc} ...).
%% 
%% |\MakeActiveLet\<char><cmd>| has been provided in 'niceverb' so far. 
%% The present package has been made in order to have 
%% `\MakeActiveLet' with 'blog.sty' as well, it was too annoying 
%% to use `\MakeActiveDef' there so often.
\gdef\MakeActiveLet{\MakeActiveAss\let}
%% 
%% === Switching Back \textellipsis ===
%% Sometimes, the ``active" behaviour of <char> is too difficult, 
%% and you may want to switch bach to its ``simple" way ... 
%% This may work by |\MakeOther\<char>| ... 
%% with \LaTeX, `\MakeOther' just is `\@makeother' ...
\ifltx \global\let\MakeOther\@makeother
\else  \gdef\MakeOther#1{\catcode`#112\relax}
\fi
%% But within a macro (or other) argument, you can't change the `\catcode'. 
%% (I~lost some time by not realizing that it was within a large argument 
%%  where I tried to switch the `\catcode'.)
%% Anyway or in certain cases, it may be better to keep a character 
%% ``active" throughout a document and just to change the \emph{expansion}
%% of the ``active-character token." This can be done with 
%% `\MakeActiveLet' and `\MakeActiveDef' in certain cases already. 
%% E.g., when the \emph{``blank space"} has been ``activated" by 
%% `\obeylines', `\MakeActiveLet\ \space' ``undoes" this half-way, 
%% while it does not restore ``argument skipping" and 
%% ``compressing blank spaces."
%% 
%% When character <char> should be ``active" for some time, 
%% but for certain moments you prefer that it behaves like an 
%% ``other character", you can switch to its ``other" expansion by 
%% |\MakeActiveOther\<char>|:
\gdef\MakeActiveOther#1{%
    \MakeActiveAss\edef#1{\expandafter\@gobble\string#1}}
%% `\MakeActiveOther' uses \LaTeX's |\@gobble<arg>|, 
%% \emph{without} \LaTeX, 'actcodes' provides it:
\ifltx\else \long\gdef\@gobble#1{} \fi
% \show_ \MakeActiveOther\_ \show_ \expandafter\show_
%% I am \emph{not} providing a version \emph{without}
%% the `\catcode' change, although the latter is superfluous here
%% TODO ...
%% 
%% `niceverb' also provides |\MakeNormal\<char>|, it may migrate %% |...| 2012/11/07
%% to here in the future, and there may be |\MakeActiveNormal\<char>|
%% extending the above `\MakeActiveOther' TODO ...
%% 
%% Also, a \emph{stack} might be used as in 'stacklet', 
%% even to switch \emph{meanings} of active-character tokens ... 
%% not sure TODO ...
%% 
%% \ctanpkgref{babel} does similar things, but I never have ... TODO
