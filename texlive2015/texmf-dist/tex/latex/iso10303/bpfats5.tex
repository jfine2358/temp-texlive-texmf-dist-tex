    General test purposes are statements of requirements that apply
to all abstract test cases, all preprocessor abstract test cases,
or all postprocessor abstract test cases. General verdict criteria
are the means for evaluating whether the general test purposes are
met. General verdict criteria shall be evaluated as a part of every
executable test case to which they apply. Each general verdict criterion
includes a reference to its associated test purpose.
