    This part of ISO 10303 specifies the abstract test suite to be
used in the conformance testing of implementations of
ISO 10303-\theAPpartno.
The following are within the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
\begin{itemize}
\item the specification of the test purposes associated with
      ISO 10303-\theAPpartno;
\item the verdict criteria to be applied during conformance
      testing of an implementation of ISO 10303-\theAPpartno\
      using ISO 10303-21 or ISO 10303-22;
  \begin{anote}
  The verdict criteria are used to ascertain whether a test purpose
  has been satisfactorily met by an implementation under test (IUT)
  within the context of a given test case.
  \end{anote}
\item the abstract test cases to be used as the basis for the
      executable test cases for conformance testing.
\end{itemize}

The following are outside the scope of this part of ISO 10303:
\begin{itemize}
\item the creation of executable test cases;
\item test specifications for tests other than conformance testing
      such as interoperability or acceptance testing;
\item other implementation methods.
\end{itemize}
