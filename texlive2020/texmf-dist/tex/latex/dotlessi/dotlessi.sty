% Usage
% ~~~~~
% This package defines two commands: \dotlessi and \dotlessj, which give 
% you access to dotless i's and j's in math mode.  They are intended for 
% symbols in non English languages.
% 
% If the default math font is used, they are equivalent to \imath and 
% \jmath; if a different font is used (like \mathrm, \mathbf, \mathsf) 
% these commands look in the corresponding font tables to find their 
% codes.  In text mode, they expand to \i and \j.  For example:
%
% $f_{\mathrm{m\acute{\dotlessj}n}}$
