% Usage
% ~~~~~
% When an environment is left open, LaTeX gives an error at the
% end of the document. However it only informs about the first
% of them, while the rest are shown with meaningless errors:
% 
% (\end occurred inside a group at level N)
% 
% This package replaces them with more useful messages
% which show which environments (in reverse order) were
% not closed.
% 
% That's all. There are no user macros. Just use the package.
