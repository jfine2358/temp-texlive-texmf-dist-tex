%   VERBATIM.STY  :::  Rainer Schoepf
%   VRBEXIN.STY   :::  You 
%                      However, it is based on vrbinput.sty, a style by 
%                      Bernd Raichle which must be revised as discussed below
%                      in the section labeled IMPORTANT
%   HERE.STY      :::  David Carlisle
%
% verbasef allows you to input (subsections of a) file, print them in
% verbatim mode, while automatically breaking up the inputted lines into
% pieces of a given length, which are output as figures.  These figures are
% posted using the [H] specification, which forces LaTeX to place the figure
% at the spot of invocation, rather than floating the figures to the top of
% the next page.
% 
% Options for the verbasef specification include:
%  o numbering of input lines
%  o differential number of lines for the first page
%  o specification of the font for the verbatim output
%  o specification of the font for the optional line numbering
%  o specification of line numbers as labels 
%    To use the labelling feature, non-standard approaches must be used.
%    A line number will be inserted into the main .aux file with label foo,
%    if the specification 
%   
%    Vzzlabel|foo|
%
%    is inserted AFTER the line which is to be indicated.  Thus, if we have 
%    a file with the following
%    
%    a line
%    b line
%    Vzzlabel|fooa|
%    c line
%    Vzzlabel|foob|
%    d line
%    Vzzlabel|fooc|
%    e line
%    f line
%    Vzzlabel|food|
% 
%    these lines will be found in the .aux file.
%    \newlabel{fooa}{{2}{1}}
%    \newlabel{foob}{{3}{1}}
%    \newlabel{fooc}{{4}{1}}
%    \newlabel{food}{{6}{1}}
%
%    They can be used as any other label, for instance 
%
%    Using the labeling feature, pay attention to Line \ref{food} (found on
%    Page \pageref{food}) to understand this radically new method.
%
%    Any lines with the Vzzlabel specification will be ignored in the 
%    line counts.

% USING THE styLE 
%
% verbasef is an adaptation of VRBSUBFILE, from Norman Walsh.  
% I fully acknowledge Mr./Dr. Walsh as the imprimature of the code ensconced
% herein, but have included other features as indicated above.
%
% Comments and suggestions always welcome.

%
% User interface:
%   VautoSubF[#1]#2#3#4#5#6
%     Input lines #2 to #3 of file #4.  If present, #1 indicates which lines
%     should be numbered.  For example, if #1 is 5, lines 5, 10, 15, etc.
%     will be numbered.  By default, lines are not numbered at all.
%     #5 is figure caption, and #6 is figure label.
%
%   VautoSfFont[#1]#2
%     Use font #2 for verbatim input lines and, if present, use font #1 for
%     line numbers.  By default, #2 is \tt and #1 is \rm\tiny.
%   
%   VautoPl#1
%     Placement of the figure (either H or some other placement character)
%     By default, placement is H (immediate here, here.sty) 
%     (This currently does not function.  All placement is done using the 
%     H specification.)
%
%   VautoLines[#1]{#2}
%     #2 is number of lines per page.  If #1 is included, it is the number of
%     lines for the first page.  If not, #1=#2

%
% In order to use the verbasef.sty file, VRBINPUT.STY must be MODIFIED
% and given a NEW NAME.  Here are instructions for modification:
%
% You must do EITHER 1-4 below OR 5 below to get verbasef to run properly.
%
% 1. Obtain vrbinput.sty from the standard distribution channels.  The file 
%    should have the following characteristics:
%
%    \fileversion{v1.0b}
%    \filedate{91/06/30}
%    \docdate{91/08/05}
%
% 2. Copy vrbinput.sty to a file vrbexin.sty.  THIS MUST BE DONE PRIOR TO
%    EDITING ANY FILE.
% 
% 3. Edit the file vrbexin.sty.  Please don't edit the file vrbinput.sty.
%    Change Line 90 from 
%    \verbatim@startline 
%    to 
%    \verbatim@start 
%    as shown in the fragment of code from Lines 89-92 below.
%
%  \def\verbatim@readfile#1{%
%     \verbatim@start
%     \openin\verbatim@in@stream #1\relax
%     \ifeof\verbatim@in@stream
%
%
% 4. VERY IMPORTANT.  CHANGE ALL OCCURRANCES of vrbinput, in titles, typeout
%    sections and credits to vrbexin.  Remove all references to the original
%    author, Bernd Raichle, as he is not the author of the style file vrbexin.
%    You may substitute my name for Mr. Raichle if you wish.
%
% 5. Obtain vrbexin.sty directly from the same subdirectory that verbasef was
%    found in.
%
% 6. Place this .sty file in a place searched by TeX, on the TEXINPUT path.
%
% After I can figure out the docstrip utility, I will do this stuff myself.
%
% Note: As is standard practice in the TeX community, any modifications in 
% .sty files must be given new names.  Thus, it is certainly vitally important
% that the modifications in vrbinput.sty be done in the file named
% vrbexin.sty, not in the original which I did not write.
