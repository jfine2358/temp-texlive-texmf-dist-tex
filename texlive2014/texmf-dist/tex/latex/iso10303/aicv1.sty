    This part of ISO~10303 is a member of the application
interpreted construct series.
    An application interpreted construct (AIC) provides a
logical grouping of interpreted constructs that supports
a specific functionality for the usage of product data across
multiple application contexts. An interpreted construct is a
common interpretation of the integrated resources that
supports shared information requirements among application
protocols.

            that supports a specific function for
            the usage of product data across multiple
            application contexts.}

\newcommand{\aicshortexpintro}{%
    This clause specifies the \Express{} schema that uses
elements from the integrated resources and contains the
types, entity data types specializations, and functions that are
specific to this part of ISO~10303.
\begin{anote}There may be subtypes and items of select lists that
      appear in the integrated resources that are not
      imported into the AIC. Constructs are eliminated
      from the subtype tree or select list through the
      use of the implicit interface rules of ISO 10303-11.
      References to eliminated constructs are outside the
      scope of the AIC. In some cases, all items of the select
      list are eliminated. Because AICs are intended to be
      implemented in the context of an application protocol,
      the items of the select list will be defined by the
      scope of the application protocol.
