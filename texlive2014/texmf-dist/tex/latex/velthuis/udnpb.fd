%    =====================================================================
%
%    This file contains the font definitions for the Bombay Pen Devanagari
%    font family in the U encoding. It is used by the LaTeX New Font
%    Selection Scheme, which is part of LaTeX2e.  The Bombay Pen Devanagari
%    font was developed by Anshuman Pandey based on the Pen Devanagari font
%    developed by Tom Ridgeway and on the Devanagari font originally
%    developed by Frans J. Velthuis. The font includes some characters
%    initially drawn by Kevin Carmody.
