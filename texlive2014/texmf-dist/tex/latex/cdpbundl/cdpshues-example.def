%%% The "\ProvidesFile" command allows LaTeX to check the name and
%%% the release date of the file; if either differs from what the
%%% user requested, a warning is issued when the file is loaded.
%%% This helps to pinpoint old files as well as files which have been
%%% installed incorrectly.  It is not mandatory to include this
%%% command in a file, and you can omit it from your definition files
%%% if you want (but including it is more elegant); however, if you do
%%% leave this command in your definition files, you should modify
%%% both its mandatory and its optional argument so that they reflect
%%% the name and the release date, respectively, of your file.
%%% Note that the extension ".def" must be included in the file name,
%%% and that the date is in the format YYYY/MM/DD.

%%% Define here the colors to use to draw the C.D.P. seal;
%%% "slight@col" is the color used to paint the inner of the D and
%%% of the P, "strong@col" is the color used to draw the lines.
%%% The colors are defined by means of the usual "\definecolor"
%%% command, which is part of the standard color package.  The colors
%%% defined here, of course, are just a silly example.
