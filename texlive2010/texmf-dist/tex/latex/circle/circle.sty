% As the name says, \Circle gives a circle in math mode. Its size lies between
% that of the binary operator \circ and that of the unary operator \bigcirc.
% It can be used as the nextstep operator of temporal logic in conjunction with
% \Box and \Diamond (latexsym) or \square and \lozenge (amssymb). \Circle[f]
% gives a filled circle.
% As you probably know, L. Lamport discouraged the use of the nextstep
% operator for program verification. This could be the reason that he did not
% provide a symbol for it in \LaTeX.
% The circles are taken from the lcircle10 font. We try to choose the
% appropriate size. If you need a high quality output, this solution will not
% suit you.

\newcommand*\Circle[1][n]{%
  \mathchoice{\@Circle{#1}{\tf@size}}{\@Circle{#1}{\tf@size}}%
             {\@Circle{#1}{\sf@size}}{\@Circle{#1}{\ssf@size}}%
}

% Bugs: circles have size n at fontsize 2n-1 and 2n; they do not scale linearly
%       depending on the fontsize
