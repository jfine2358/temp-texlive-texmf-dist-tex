====================
EXPLANATORY COMMENTS
====================

This file is special in that the cdpaddon package stops reading it as
soon as it encounters the first "\DeclareCDPSealHuesDefault" command:
all subsequent lines are ignored, and can hence contain explanatory
comments, just like these.  To save disk space (although, in this era
of gigabytes, this is not a compelling issue!), you can, if you want,
delete all lines in this file except the one which contains the first
occurrence of a "\DeclareCDPSealHuesDefault" command (12 lines above);
but if you do so, please be sure to read them before deleting them!
(Anyway, I think it is a good idea to leave the comments in place.)

The "\DeclareCDPSealHuesDefault" command has one argument, in which
you should put the name of a default file from which the definitions
of the hues for the C.D.P. seal are read when no other file has been
indicated in the options passed to the cdpaddon package.  Note that
the extension ".def" is automatically added to the name; therefore,
you **must** leave it out in the name given as the argument of the
"\DeclareCDPSealHuesDefault" command.

The C.D.P. Bundle comes with some definition files already included;
their names are listed below, without the extension ".def" (each one
is packaged in a "\DeclareCDPSealHuesDefault" command):

\DeclareCDPSealHuesDefault{cdpshues-example}
\DeclareCDPSealHuesDefault{epson-stylus-740}
\DeclareCDPSealHuesDefault{hp-laserjet-4500}

To make one of these files the default one, copy (or move) the line
containing its name to the top of the file, so that its becomes the
first line (yes, even above the opening comments, those four dozens
lines starting with "%%": let us keep things easy!).

If you write a new definition file, you can make it the default by
writing a similar "\DeclareCDPSealHuesDefault" command and putting it
in the first line of this file (above the opening comments, why not).
Remember that only the first such command appearing in this file is
taken into consideration: all subsequent lines are ignored.
