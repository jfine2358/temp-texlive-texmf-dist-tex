secdot.sty: section numbers with dots
=====================================

the package as loaded causes section numbers to be output with a dot
after them.

the command \sectiondot{<level>} will make `level' sections also be
output with a dot after them -- an example of use would be:
   \sectiondot{subsection}

the command \sectionpunct{<level>}{<punctuation>} gives finer
control.  examples of use would be
   \sectionpunct{section}{. } % \sectiondot places a \quad after the
                              % dot, which may look excessive
   \sectionpunct{section}{\quad} % restores default latex behaviour

other eccentricities of numbering could be coded by those with
stronger stomachs, by defining the appropriate

   \csname @seccntfmt@<level>\endcsname

which macro will take one argument, when invoked: the `level' name
