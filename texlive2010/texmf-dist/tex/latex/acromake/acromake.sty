%% This algorithm is presented and discussed in TeX and TUG News, V4, #1.
%% The algorithm as presented there has several small problems, which are
%% solved here.
%% 
%% This file generates acronyms.  There are three parameters which may be
%% set by the user
%% 1. To generate an acronym
%%    \acromk{ANSA}{{\tt ANSA}}{another nasty stupid acronym}
%%
%%    The first argument is the name used in text to implement the acronym.
%%    The second argument is the name printed in the text when the acronym
%%    is used.  The final argument is the full, non-acronymized version.
%%
%%    So, if there was an acronym 
%%    \acromake{ANSA}{{\tt ANSA}}{another nasty stupid acronym}
%%    it could be used as 
%%
%%    \ANSA is a new approach to the use of \ANSA, where \ANSA is ...
%% 
%%    This would result in
%%
%%    another nasty stupid acronym ({\tt ANSA}) is a new approach to 
%%    the use of {\tt ANSA}, where {\tt ANSA} is ...
%%    
%% 2. To use the acronym
%%    here \ANSA whatever {foo}lish use of acronym you wish
%%    This will generate the following:
%%      Usage number           Resolved text
%%           1              another nasty stupid acronym (ANSA) 
%%           2              ANSA (page 2) 
%%           3 (and beyond) ANSA
%%
%% 3. The following may be set by the user:
%%    ACRcnta  - count of uses of acronym macro which will be in full form  
%%               (default is 1)
%%    ACRcntb  - count of uses of acronym macro which will include page of
%%               acronym def (default is 1 reference, or ACRcntb-ACRcnta)
%%    useACRlb - should the page reference be used - 1-yes, 0-no
%%
%% For every acronym, the macro generates the acronym macro and a macro which
%% acts like a counter for acronym use.  Since counters are quite rare, it is
%% not responsible to use a counter for every acronym - rather, a macro is
%% generated which fills this function.  The acronym macro is called \foo,
%% while the counter macro is called \fooz.  Thus, I would avoid calling any
%% acronym fooz, as this may be confoozing.
%% 
%% The .sty file generates 1 counter if it is included.  For each acronym
%% specified, the .sty file generates two macros, 1 for the acronym, and 1 for
%% the count of acronym use
