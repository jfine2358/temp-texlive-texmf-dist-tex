%% mfparxsp.sty earlier defined \MFparaxbuffer. 
%% manyfoot version 1.7 (September 2004) defines 
%% \ExtraParaSkip instead, so former mfpaxsp.sty is 
%% ***obsolete***. You may use the present file to 
%% convert \MFparaxbuffer of your earlier document files 
%% into \ExtraParaSkip, or just to remind you of the change 
%% later. (On CTAN, the new manyfoot version is obtainable 
%% from directory /macros/latex/contrib/ncctools/.) 
%% See explanation of \ExtraParaSkip in ednotes.sty

*Florian Kragl's earlier suggestion:* 
In preamble, type
    \setlength{\footnotesep}{<fns>} 
    \renewcommand*\footnoterule{\kern-<ra>\hrule\kern-<rb>} 
Here, find good values for <fns>, <ra>, and <rb> by trial and error.
